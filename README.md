# Glad2-CMake

This is a convenience wrapper in CMake of the original library created by [Dav1dde](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad).
I created it so that Glad can be used with CMake's FetchContent or vcpkg instead of having it as loose files and as extra
CMake target in the project. 

OpenGL Loader for OpenGL 4.6 generated with the [Glad2 Generator](https://gen.glad.sh/#generator=c&api=gl%3D4.6&profile=gl%3Dcore%2Cgles1%3Dcommon).

## Requirements

- CMake 3.30+
- C++23 compatible compiler
